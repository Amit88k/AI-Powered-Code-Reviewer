#### AI-Powered Code Reviewer

This project tackles a real-world inefficiency in the development workflow: manual code reviews of Snowflake SQL, Python stored procedures, and Snowpark logic.

Using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 API, this solution automates the code review process‚Äîenhancing productivity, reducing repetitive work, and providing scalable AI feedback across roles.


## üí°Use Case: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant
üîß Problems Faced (Manual Workflow)

As a team lead, I spend significant time reviewing code changes. Often:

- Reviewing repetitive code patterns (e.g., null checks, naming conventions, repeated logic)
- Commenting on similar issues repeatedly across PRs
- Lack consistency in quality
- Miss hidden inefficiencies (like SELECT * or full table scans)
- Missing subtle anti-patterns or performance concerns due to fatigue or time pressure
- Consume bandwidth of experienced developers
- Context-switching across multiple PRs, teams, or modules

## ‚è± Inefficiency:

This process takes 2‚Äì3 hours/week per project and slows down PR turnaround time, affecting team velocity.


## üéØ Hackathon Goal

Automate code review for Code reviews using AI to:

- Identify anti-patterns in SQL and Snowpark logic
- Reduce time spent on manual reviews
- Provide scalable, explainable feedback for teams


## ü§ñ AI-Based Solution Overview

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling:
CodiumAI / DeepCode / CodeRabbit ‚Äì LLM-based GitHub-integrated code review bots
Or DIY with OpenAI GPT-4, repo parser (e.g., Tree-sitter), and GitHub PR API

## üß† How It Works (High-Level):
AI model reads a Pull Request diff
Identifies issues like poor naming, missing edge-case handling, redundant logic, security or style violations
Auto-generates comments or suggestions directly on the PR or outputs a markdown summary
Can be fine-tuned to learn team-specific patterns or integrate into CI pipelines
